# agent-sdk-examples

Runnable, minimal examples of programmatic agent usage. Each example is a small,
self-contained TypeScript script you can run with a single `npm` command — no
boilerplate, just the SDK feature it demonstrates.

Examples are run with [`tsx`](https://github.com/privatenumber/tsx), so there is
no build step.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in your keys
```

Every example loads `.env` at startup (via `dotenv`), so put your keys there:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...    # anthropic/* examples (optional — see below)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-... # ai-sdk/* examples (required)
```

`.env` is gitignored; `.env.example` is the committed template.

The **Claude Agent SDK** (`anthropic/*`) also runs through the locally installed
`claude` CLI and reuses its Claude Code login, so `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is optional
if that CLI is already authenticated. The **Vercel AI SDK** examples (`ai-sdk/*`)
have no implicit auth and always need `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.

## Anthropic — Claude Agent SDK

Examples live in [`anthropic/`](./anthropic) and revolve around a small code-review
agent. The sample diffs they review are in [`data/`](./data) — by default the
scripts read `data/sample-1.md`; pass another sample as an argument, or pipe a real
diff via stdin:

```bash
npm run anthropic:review              # uses data/sample-1.md
npm run anthropic:review -- sample-2  # uses data/sample-2.md
git diff | npm run anthropic:review   # review your working tree
```

| Script | File | What it shows |
|--------|------|---------------|
| `npm run anthropic:review` | [`review.ts`](./anthropic/review.ts) | A focused review agent that returns **structured JSON output** enforced by a JSON Schema. |
| `npm run anthropic:session` | [`review-with-session.ts`](./anthropic/review-with-session.ts) | **Session resume** — review once, then ask a follow-up that reuses the prior context without re-sending the diff. |
| `npm run anthropic:skill` | [`skill-autoload.ts`](./anthropic/skill-autoload.ts) | **Skill autoload** — the agent discovers and applies `.claude/skills/greeting` on its own. |
| `npm run anthropic:cost` | [`cost-report.ts`](./anthropic/cost-report.ts) | Reads **cost and token usage** from the result message and writes a report to `anthropic/cost.json`. |

## Vercel AI SDK — assemble-it-yourself agent

The same code-review agent, built with the **Vercel AI SDK 6** (`ToolLoopAgent`)
instead of a batteries-included harness. Each example mirrors its `anthropic/`
counterpart so you can read the two categories side by side. The model is
imported explicitly — here **GLM via OpenRouter** (`z-ai/glm-5.1`) — so swapping
providers is a one-line change.

Authentication: unlike the Claude examples, these need an explicit key —
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in your `.env` (see [Setup](#setup)).

```bash
npm run aisdk:review              # uses data/sample-1.md
npm run aisdk:review -- sample-2  # uses data/sample-2.md
git diff | npm run aisdk:review   # review your working tree
```

| Script | File | What it shows |
|--------|------|---------------|
| `npm run aisdk:review` | [`review.ts`](./ai-sdk/review.ts) | A `ToolLoopAgent` returning **structured output** validated by a Zod schema (`Output.object`). |
| `npm run aisdk:session` | [`review-with-session.ts`](./ai-sdk/review-with-session.ts) | **No built-in session** — you carry a `messages[]` history yourself across two passes (structured review, then plain-text recall). |
| `npm run aisdk:rules` | [`rules-inject.ts`](./ai-sdk/rules-inject.ts) | **Nothing is inherited** — the SDK ignores `.claude/skills`, so the skill file is read from disk and injected into `instructions` manually. |
| `npm run aisdk:cost` | [`cost-report.ts`](./ai-sdk/cost-report.ts) | Reads **token usage** (`totalUsage`, `onStepFinish`) plus OpenRouter's real **cost** (`providerMetadata`, `usage: { include: true }`); writes `ai-sdk/cost.json`. |

## Evals — model comparison with promptfoo

The [`evals/`](./evals) directory wires the AI SDK review agent into
[**promptfoo**](https://promptfoo.dev) to compare multiple OpenRouter models
against the same diffs. Needs `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.

```bash
npm run evals        # run the evaluation matrix
npm run evals:view   # open the promptfoo web UI to browse results
```

**How it works:**

1. **Prompt axis** — each raw diff from `data/` is fed directly to the agent as
   the user prompt; the reviewer instructions live in `common/review-schema.ts`
   as the system prompt (`REVIEWER_PROMPT`).
2. **Provider axis** — [`provider.ts`](./evals/provider.ts) is a single custom
   promptfoo provider that wraps the AI SDK `ToolLoopAgent`; the model slug
   (`google/gemini-3.5-flash`, `z-ai/glm-5.1`, `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`) is
   injected via `config.model` in the YAML so one file covers all three models.
3. **Assertions** — two default assertions run on every cell:
   - **Schema** ([`tests/assert-schema.ts`](./evals/tests/assert-schema.ts)) —
     validates the JSON output against the shared Zod `ReviewResult`.
   - **Range** — checks all six criterion scores are integers in `1–10` and the
     `verdict` is `pass`/`fail`.
4. **LLM-as-a-judge** — per-sample `llm-rubric` assertions check whether the
   `summary` (or a criterion `rationale`) caught a specific flaw (e.g. SQL
   injection, plaintext password, missing keyboard handler). Each rubric is tagged with a `metric`
   name so the promptfoo results grid shows which model detected which flaw.
   The judge itself runs through OpenRouter on `claude-sonnet-4.6` — a stronger
   model than the reviewers being evaluated.
